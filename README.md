Audio Transcription AIED 
===============================

The Audio Transcription Intelligent Tutoring System is a series of learning exercises with automated feedback for developing skills related to audio
transcription. 

The primary knowledge components for the system is the transcription of rhythm into classical notation, and the recognition of intervals in music
provided a starting note. The system does not aim to teach students to recognize certain notes, merely the intervals and chord qualities associated with certain 
sounds. Furthermore, the system assumes a basic understanding of musical knowledge before entering the system, only providing an interface to hone these skills, 
rather than teach them in the first place.

This means that the system will help hone the ability to recognize intervals, but will not provide a specific lesson on different intervals in the first place. 
Additionally, the system assumes student are familiar with note lengths and classical musicial notation before beginning tutoring sessions. Thus the 
system assumes knowledge of sixteenth, eighth, quarter, half, and whole notes; both in their appearance and the length of the components in musical notation. The
sustem hopes to help students recognize these components in music, not learn these components on their own. 



Interval Recognition
-----------------------------



Rhythm Transcription
------------------------------

Students will be expected to hear an audio playback of music, both with melody, and without. Though, all sequences are expected to be monophonic due to systems and learner limitations. 

 Following the listening of the given excerpt, students will be expected to represent the sequence in rhythm notation. 

Students will be presented with a clear four bar music sheet, and a series of drag and drop icons for differing lengths of music. Students will be expected to listen to the
music, and transcribe the rhythm onto the sheet music. 

For example, a musical sequence may play four quarter notes, one for each bar. The learner will then be expected to place four quarter notes at the start of each 
measure as well as the corresponding number of rests.

Reading Rhythm Transcription Files
-------------------------------

The rhythm transcription files are structured in terms of 16th notes. No transcription will exceed sixteenth subdivison intervals and triplets 
will not be considered. Rhythm transcription files will appear as such. "," characters represent a 16th note rest. q represents a quarter note. 


        q,,,,q,,,,;q,,,,q,,,,;q,,,,q,,,,;q,,,,q,,,,;

This can be expaded to differeing characters. For example, 

w -> whole note
h -> half note
q -> quarter note
e -> eigth note
s -> sixtheenth note

Rhythm transcription files may appear in any valid combination as appears above and are read from a static file.
